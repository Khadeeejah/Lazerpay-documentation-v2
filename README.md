# Welcome to Lazerpay Docs ðŸ‘‹

This is the repository for the Lazerpay documentation site
[docs.lazerpay.finance][wi]. Lazerpay Documentation accepts contributions via GitHub pull requests. This document outlines some contributing guidelines,
contact points, and other resources to make it easier to contribute to
lazerpay-documentation-v2.

If you've run into a problem or have a suggestion, browse the open [issues][is]
before opening a new one. We use the following [label system][la] to organize
our issues.

- ![][cr] for typos, broken links, and other quick fixes
- ![][tr] for additions to the FAQ and Troubleshooting sections
- ![][im] for revisions, rewrites, and larger improvements
- ![][fe] for feedback on structure & content
- ![][qu] for questions that can't be answered via documentation
- ![][fi] for improvements and fixups related to the look and feel of the docs
  site

### Best practices for managing contributions

- If a question is asked more than twice in the documenttion channel, it should be
  added as an outstanding ![][tr] issue. If a resolution is found, it should be
  captured in the issue before it's closed or in a following pull request.
  Those involved in the support process should contribute to the documentation
  (i.e. if you answered the question, be sure to capture the outcome in the
  relevant documentation).

- If a piece of unaddressed feedback is given more than three times, a ![][fe]
  issue should be created and added to the [Feedback Hub][fh] to be prioritized
  in the following weekly sync.

- Issues will be reviewed on a rolling basis and triaged weekly by
  @MeisterJustice and @Frontend-io
