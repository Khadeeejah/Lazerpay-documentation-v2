With Zag, you can build accessible UI components in React, Solid and Vue without
sweating over the logic.

## What is our motivation

In [Chakra UI React](https://chakra-ui.com/), we've experienced too many hiccups
and bugs in the past related to how we coordinate events, manage state, and side
effects. Most these bugs are associated with the orchestration within
`useEffect`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`, etc.

These issues were replicated in our [Chakra UI Vue](https://vue.chakra-ui.com/)
pursuit as well, and created a maintenance hell for us. We're grateful for this
experience because it made us take a step back to define how we would like to
build components in the future.

We believe that most widgets should function the same way regardless of the
framework they're built with. That's why we built Zag.
